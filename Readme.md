# Group Recommendation based on Collaborative Filtering and Markov Chains

In this work, we present an end-to-end group recommendation pipeline, based on predicting restaurant ratings for individual users via collaborative ﬁltering, followed by aggregating the individual restaurant rankings for a group. For collaborative ﬁltering, graph-regularized joint matrix factorization is employed, and the rank aggregation is solved via Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. Our whole system is trained on a dataset provided by Yelp as part of a public challenge. We have tested the recommendation pipeline from end to end as well as the individual components. Whereas our evaluation results based on Kendall-Tau distances are promising, further real world experiments should be conducted.
